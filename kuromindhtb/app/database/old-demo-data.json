        "title": "Moonstep Kata",
        "description": "Among the Seiryoku clan's oldest arts, Moonstep Kata is taught beneath moonlit ponds where reflections ripple like breath. Practitioners must still their pulse until it matches the lunar rhythm—each heartbeat becoming a step. The jutsu bends light, letting the body slip through mirrored surfaces for an instant. Young scouts use it to cross rivers unseen, but masters claim they can step through their own shadow. Learning it demands serenity; fear causes the reflection to shatter, dragging the student momentarily beneath the water. Veterans describe it as walking within their own memory, always one step ahead of regret.",

        "description": "In the shrines of Nagame Glen, priestesses once used fallen blossoms as vessels of prayer. By exhaling upon the petals while chanting the Sutra of Falling Bloom, they weave transient armor from living color. The Petal Veil forms briefly when the caster's heart is pure; it fractures if cast from vengeance. Each petal vibrates in sympathy with its caster's emotions. When serenity holds, the barrier hums softly like windchimes. Travelers report shrine maidens raising these veils to shield entire processions from storms. Overuse drains the caster's warmth, leaving them frost-bitten even in spring.",

        "description": "The monks of Yuzuki Temple teach that every breath carries memory. This gentle spell is cast by whispering a loved one's name into a small flame. When released, the lantern rises, drawing on the soul's warmth to keep yokai at bay. The lanterns drift toward places of sorrow, guiding lost travelers. To perform it, one must breathe steadily—if breath falters, the light flickers out and memories scatter. The spell is simple but sacred: many villages still release these lanterns during eclipses to remind the world that not all darkness devours light.",

When their reflection aligns perfectly, they may speak one truth aloud. The ripples then carry deceit away. Warriors use it before battle to clear fear; spies use it to detect lies. The seal fails if the user's name is false or their heart divided. Elders warn that those who gaze too long into the stillness may see futures they were not meant to witness—ripples that never reach the shore.",

Reading aloud in reverse cadence causes hidden text to bloom, revealing layers of truth and memory. Students learn it to decode ancient sutras; spies use it to uncover forgeries. However, after prolonged exposure, the ink begins responding—recording the reader's thoughts instead of the writer's. Chroniclers whisper that a few scribes went mad after seeing their own nightmares written in the margins.",

Through meditation, one visualizes each aspect orbiting the core like stars around a moon. When properly aligned, chakra and conscience flow harmoniously, granting focus even in battle. Many lose their way when one aspect dominates—most often Will, which blinds the others. Advanced users report seeing faint geometric lights beneath their eyelids, a sign that their spirit mirrors the world's hidden order.",

The caster writes a single heartfelt message upon a rice charm, breathes onto it, and releases it into the wind. The charm dissolves, carrying words to the person most connected to the sender. The wind accepts only truth—lies or hatred cause it to disintegrate prematurely. Messengers of old used it to send warnings during the Shadow Wars. The Sutra is often practiced by lovers separated by duty, and many believe their whispers ride the monsoon even now.",

By pressing the palm against a living being or object, the user leaves a pulse—a fragment of their heartbeat that links two fates. Allies connected by Pulse Mark can sense one another's emotions and danger even across distance. Used wisely, it forms a perfect battle unit; used recklessly, it shares pain and fear. When a marked ally dies, others hear a final heartbeat echo within their ribs. Masters say this jutsu teaches compassion before strategy: to feel, one must first risk being broken.",

By tracing these threads, investigators can reconstruct conversations long past. Casting it requires a silk strand dipped in temple oil and held between the fingers while listening to the wind. When the thread vibrates, the echoes of speech begin to replay around the caster like ghostly murmurs. The weave lasts as long as concentration holds. Monks use it to settle disputes; spies use it to learn the truth others forgot. However, each use frays the listener's sense of present time—they may speak to voices that have already faded.",

After seven nights, a shadow-flower sprouts where it was buried. The flower can drain the life of any creature that steps upon its petals, transferring their vitality back to the caster. The ritual mimics the life-cycle of Shinju's corrupted roots, twisting nature to serve hunger. Although it grants immortality to some degree, the flower demands continuous sacrifice. Those who plant too many Eclipse Seeds become forests of shadows, their bodies petrified beneath black blossoms.",

          "description": "Among the relics sealed beneath the Saihō-in Temple, this forbidden spell survives only in fragments. It describes a ritual in which the caster forges a liquid mirror using silver dust and the blood of a scribe. By chanting one's name three times before it, the reflection begins to dissolve, erasing that identity from the world. The caster may then assume another's name, stealing their existence in full—memories, status, even relationships shift to fit the impostor. When the mirror's surface stills, both souls are bound: one walks free, the other forever trapped in reflection. Only Kurozan's inner scribes dared use it, replacing nobles overnight. None were seen again without glassy eyes.",

As darkness falls, every nearby shadow detaches from its owner, obeying the user's command. Within the Veil, whispers replace sound; resistance causes one's own shadow to turn upon them. Once mastered by Kurozan himself, it was said he could wage war through a thousand silhouettes while his body remained unseen. Those who attempt it risk losing their reflection forever.",

Every beat erases the last few seconds for all but the caster, leaving behind faint spectral afterimages. In battle, it feels like fighting the same opponent twice. The cost, however, is grave—each activation shortens the caster's lifespan by a day, their pulse growing quieter until silence becomes eternal. The last known user was found with no heartbeat but eyes wide open, as if still counting.",

The droplets crystallize midair into floating shards of black glass that orbit defensively. Each absorbs one strike, then echoes the attacker's dying emotion in whispers. The user grows weaker with every petal formed, their veins turning darker as the bloom feeds. Legends say the forge-master Goro nearly perfected it, but his heart rebelled; he chose to break the spell rather than hear his enemies' sorrow forever.",

The script moves like living ink, consuming words around it until the page becomes empty. Scholars who attempted to transcribe it vanished from their own ledgers, leaving only blank spaces. The spell promises absolute secrecy and dominion over silence itself; one could command mute obedience or erase an entire confession. But its cost is identity: to wield it is to be forgotten even by your own reflection.",
